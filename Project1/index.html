    <img src="/Web_development/Project1/image/houseblend.jpeg" alt="house blend coffee">
    <p>Coffee is consumed worldwide – the industry ranges from the growth, production, and distribution. There are so many different blends, brands, and beans that it can be difficult to understand what can make each cup of coffee different from the other.
        A blend of coffee is the result of combining two different beans to produce different flavors and strengths. Blends are not standardized in the coffee industry, making it difficult to fully grasp the core differences between cups. In order to
        define a House Blend coffee, you must first understand the basic components of roasting coffee.</p>
